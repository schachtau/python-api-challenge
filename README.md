  API's or Application Programming Interfaces, are valuable tools that allow computers and specifically programs/software to communicate with each other. 
in a sense API's run our digital world in the modern age. The other great aspect of API's is their security. Much like you get into your house with a key, there are SSH keys that only allow specific people or systems to access data coming across the network of API's. 
  In this project we analyzed specific aspects of weather such as temperature, wind, humidity etc. across random cities using an API that provides the data for. We can then use visual tools such as scatter plots to calculate linear regression. We compared latitide and longitude against the weather variables to get the regression. We also compared the northern and southern hemispheres. We found that the lower the latitude (in terms of integers) the warmer the weather was on average, or the max daily temp. 
  understanding the dependencies necessary to get accurate information through the use of API's such as citypy which has its own rules when writing even basic code.
